# Black Lives Matter Protest Project Index

The purpose of this project is to provide a list of collaborative efforts that document or display information about abuse of police power in the Black Lives Matter protests. This may be used to facilitate consolidating efforts.

Of course, this project is a collaborative effort in itself, and if another such project exists, consolidating the lists would be preferable.
